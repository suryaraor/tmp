Based on the conversation context, here are the key decisions that were made:

For the GRU SLA, it was decided to use the same local time (6:30 PM) for the remaining two countries (Italy and France) as was used for the three countries (Ireland, London, and Italy) where the SLA was already finalized.

The team agreed to include the GRU feed in the onboarding exercise for new countries, at least for the two-way reconciliation where the ownership is defined with Olympus.

For the business tickets, the team confirmed they will be defaulting the GFCID and CRGID fields instead of sending null values, following the same logic as for the Treasury tickets.

The team discussed options for handling the floating rate loan contracts where the next reset date is not available on the contract reset date. They agreed to create a provisional ticket on the reset date using the previous rate, and then reverse it the next day when the new rate is available.

The team decided to test the end-of-day process in the UAT environment by creating sample assignments and portfolios, before implementing the changes in production.


Here is a high-level summary of the key discussion points:

GRU SLA and Loan IQ Approval:

   - Discussions around the GRU SLA and the need to finalize it for the remaining countries.
   - Talks about the conditional approval for the Loan IQ process and the need to review the BRT process.

Ownership and Migration Plan for GRU:

   - Discussions on the ownership of the two-way and three-way reconciliation records.
   - Proposal to include GRU in the onboarding exercise to streamline the migration process.

Business Tickets and Data Quality:

   - Decision to default the GFCID and CRGID fields on business tickets instead of sending null.
   - Discussions around the logic for handling business tickets and the potential impact on high-volume transactions.

Floating Rate Contracts and Ticket Creation:

   - Challenges in creating tickets for floating rate contracts due to the availability of the next reset date.
   - Proposal to create provisional tickets and reverse them the next day if necessary.
   - Plan to analyze the data quality for specific geographies and products.

Model ID and Data Migration Issues:

   - Concerns raised about the use of dynamic model IDs causing issues during data migration.
   - Plan to use the static model ID instead and potentially apply a data patch to fix the issue.

Day Zero and Day One Testing:

   - Discussions around the plan for testing the new setup, including intraday processing and GRE record feed.
   - Emphasis on validating the data in the full suite to ensure proper loading and accuracy.

Assignment and Portfolio Configuration:
