Based on the conversation context, here are the key decisions that were made:

For the GRU SLA, it was decided to use the same local time (6:30 PM) for the remaining two countries (Italy and France) as was used for the three countries (Ireland, London, and Italy) where the SLA was already finalized.

The team agreed to include the GRU feed in the onboarding exercise for new countries, at least for the two-way reconciliation where the ownership is defined with Olympus.

For the business tickets, the team confirmed they will be defaulting the GFCID and CRGID fields instead of sending null values, following the same logic as for the Treasury tickets.

The team discussed options for handling the floating rate loan contracts where the next reset date is not available on the contract reset date. They agreed to create a provisional ticket on the reset date using the previous rate, and then reverse it the next day when the new rate is available.

The team decided to test the end-of-day process in the UAT environment by creating sample assignments and portfolios, before implementing the changes in production.
